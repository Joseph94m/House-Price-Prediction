# House Price Prediction    

Starting from 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, we try to predict the final price of each home.    

Our final score on the kaggle submission leaderboard was RMSE= 0.1239. This puts us at about the top 20% in the competition.
